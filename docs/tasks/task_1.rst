==============
Task 1: Readme
==============

Please create a seperate branch for each task and create a
Merge Request every time.
You can find detailed instructions on the :ref:`git-workflow` page.

TODO (Task 1): Please add a small Readme in the format reStructuredText.
So you should change the file ``README.rst``.

It should contain:

* the repositoryâ€™s purpose
* an installation guide
* a small snippet how to use the command line interfact

Please keep in mind:

* indention is 3 spaces
* blank lines are important to seperate blocks from each other

After merging your Merge Request you should see your new ``README.rst`` at the
landing page of your project
``https://git.tu-berlin.de/kiwi-git-workshops/your_project``.
