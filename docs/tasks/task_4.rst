==================
Task 4: Docstrings
==================

In the last workshop we dealt with a function called ``invert_image``. You can
find it in this package as well

.. code-block:: python

   your_package_name.processing.invert_image

Please write a docstring for that function. Here you can find more detailed
instructions on :ref:`detaileddocstring`.

Once you added a Docstring, please add another file that describes the process
of inverting an image to the documentation. Then use the autofunction feature
to include the Docstring into the documentation.

If you encounter an error like

.. code-block::

   WARNING: autodoc: failed to import function 'some.module'

make sure that you installed the package into your current enviroment.
