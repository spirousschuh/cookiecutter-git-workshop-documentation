Documentation 101
=================

The most basic piece of documentation is a Readme.


Readme
______

When creating a repository it is a good practise to add a Readme right from
the start. Its the first point of touch with your repository.

Content
-------

A basic Readme should contain the following:

* the repository's purpose
* an installation guide
* a small code snippet of a typical use-case
* a note on contribution
* how you liscense your project (default choice: https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)

Purpose
-------

I advice you to write documentation, because

* essential if someone else will start using your software
* you reflect your own design choices while explaining them to the user
* in case of multiple users its the most efficient way to handle questions
* great lookup for yourself
